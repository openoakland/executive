Volunteers

Tarik: Created a roadmap for volunteers that we can/should put on our website

list steps that are needed to participate

In its current iteration, it is not interactive

Volunteer app is being created?

Gather information about our volunteers

identify holes and different skills that we may not be getting

**Neil:** want to balance need for human contact and better systems for onboarding new volunteers.

Expressed database management and the importance of human interaction

Would like to stay providing this warm welcoming

Question about Volunteer app

will it replace meetup or will

**marketing**

- First meeting last week committed to ?
- Mai-ling is partnering on two projects...low hanging fruit
- oak 72, the earthquake preparedness/response. Won't dive into that into next month and seeing what they can do in between hack nights
- Tony: collateral that we can use?

Look to broaden the team a little bit

**Outreach**

Thoughts in the last couple of months.

Some items possibly a larger retreat discussion

- how best to approach?
- strategic goals
- do projects that don't have partnerships need partnerships

Spike:

- At max we can sustain 6 apps with no partners
- app can't be a random thing that we don't have any partnership on
- oak72 has support outside of OO
- Open disclosure had a partner
- Everything that we've launched as an official app has had a partner
- Worth retreat time to discuss further

Phil:

- Disagrees, partners came onboard so to speak after the app was successful

We should be able to succeed with or without a partner

**Development**

Ellie:

- plan in the works
- diversified revenue stream plan
- foundation grants aren't' the only way to fund OO
- Ellie has created a strategy that can cultivate relationships further down the line
- draft development plan, a prospect list
- draft impact report outline
- This week for $25k accelerator grant (spike, eddie, ellie)
- Created video submission...needs to be edited before submitting
- Individual prospects, donor profiles; profiles for donors
- Thinking about different levels of volunteering such as group volunteering

Deep: Great to have a mechanism for volunteer input

**Discussion topics:**

**Technology & infrastructure**

**3 prong role**

1)learning

- helping to introduce those technologies to the group (volunteers)

2) Help in any work associated with

- Volunteer app for example, tech team should help with

3) Being involved with special projects

- have some role in helping with those city projects

Questions:

Phil

- what is different from the job description?
- Open data portal should be owned by deep, not spike. 
- Spike, it should be owned by someone who has a passion for it

Neil, teaching thing? Curious about this, sees it as a shift.

- Key for us to get our own technology needs in order

Tony

- Love the idea, but very ambitious...concerned about that
- Didn't hear mentioned, coordinating technologies internally. A way to systemize
- oversee other sys ops

 Tarik,  feels like we have to come up with some way to build out our leadership teams

Spike, biggest weakness in building the capacity of our volunteers

learning something new is really important

Other tech groups to contribute to training

Ellie, agree education needs to be more at the forefront. A level of engagement we need to sustain ourselves. Would like to park a conversation on how to

April- need creative ways to focus on educating volunteers/community.

Deep, knows it's an ambitious goal and he is open to work with all on it

Volunteer app, discussed the nuances of the app

- For example, a button 
- managing data in a technological way
- it will not take away from the human experience
- looking to recruit a team! Very excited about idea!
